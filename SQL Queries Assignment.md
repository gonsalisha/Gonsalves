# SQL Queries Assignment

## Query Series 1
**User :** [Tohaomg](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/Tohaomg)   

**URLs :** 
           [Biggest files by size](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/14660)    
           [Images on Commons by area](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/14661)  
           [Images on Commons by area including svg images](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/14659)  
           [Biggest svg images by size](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/15842)
                     
**Explanation :** In my opinion, Tohaomg was querying the English and Ukranian wikisource and trying to retrieve larger size interactive images (svg). The svg images are good for responsive websites. The user maybe wants to check how they scale on different devices, therefore checking the scaling using larger svg images first.


## Query Series 2    
**User :**  [The Polish](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/The%20Polish)  

**URLs :** [Top edited overall articles in 2016 on pl.wiki](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/14975)  
           [Most active users by articles on plwiki](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/1317)  
           [Most active users by bytes on plwiki](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/2191)     
           
**Explanation :** User, The Polish is querying the Polish wikisource. I think the user is trying to determine active users interested in working on wiki pages. The Polish queries to find users with high edits on articales overall and monthly and maybe suggest them to freelance or work for Wikimedia commons _Polish_.  


## Query Series 3  
**User :** [Titodutta](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/Titodutta)  

**URLs :** [Punjab edit-a-thon: Malayalam Wikipedia](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/11536)    
           [Punjab edit-a-thon: Punjabi Wikipedia articles](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/11349)    
           [Punjab edit-a-thon - Bengali Wikipedia](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/11351)  
           [Punjab edit-a-thon: English Wikipedia](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/11353)  
           [Punjab edit-a-thon: Tamil Wikipedia articles](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/11354)     
           [Punjab edit-a-thon Hindi Wikipedia](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/11355)  
           [Punjab edit-a-thon: Telugu Wikipedia](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/11356)  
           
**Explanation :** The user, Titodutta is querying all the articles created in different language wikipedia sources during the Punjab edit-a-thon.This maybe done to keep a record of all the articles that were created during that time. It is possible that the user may used this query to check if the articles were placed in the correct language wikis, or even trying to find out many articles were created in all the different language wikis.
