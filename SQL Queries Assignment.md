## Query Series 1
**User :** [Tohaomg](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/Tohaomg)

           [Biggest files by size](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/14660)

           [Biggest svg images by size](https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/15842)

The user maybe wants to check how they scale on different devices therefore checking the scaling using larger svg images first.
